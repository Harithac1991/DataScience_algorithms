I am trying UnLearn and ReLearn some of the ML techniques that I learned 5 years ago.
I accepted the fact that I have a huge dependency on the handwritten notebooks/notes/ I make during learning process.
Recently one of my friend suggested to move to git to keep my notes.
I am taking my baby steps for keeping my notes in here. But I still maintain handwritten note ( with less effort).
I apologise in advance for all the spelling and formatting mistakes you would see in here.
I would like to keep it dirty since it is my rough note :P
