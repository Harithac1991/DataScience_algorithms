I am trying Unlear an dRelarn some o fthe ML techniques i learned 5 years ago
I have a huge dependency on the not ei make during learning something
Recently one of my friend suggested that git is the best for you keep your notes on
I am making my baby steps for keeping my notes in cloud although i still maintain handwritten note
It is been said that when you use all your senses while doing something, chances are high that you would remember it for long
Also apologies in advance for all the spelling and formatting mistakes you see here. I would like to keep it dirty since it is my rough note :P
