AI accepted the fact that I have a huge dependency on the notebooks/notes/ I make during learning process.

I am taking my baby steps for keeping my notes in here although I still maintain handwritten notes but with less effort.
Also apologies in advance for all the spelling and formatting mistakes you see here.
I would like to keep it dirty since it is my rough note :P
